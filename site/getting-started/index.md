# What is Pinguino?

There are so many great platforms for creating digitally enabled devices that its gotten
hard to figure out which one to use. Arduino is maybe one of the most famous, but it is based
on ATMEL Microcontrollers and the boards are difficult to build or expensive in Latin America
 or others countries.

The goal of **Pinguino Project** is to bring the simplicity of Arduino language to the 
PIC ©Microchip Microcontrollers but with buil-in USB hardware and a board that you can build 
in your house.

* Pinguino is an Open Source Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
* Pinguino is an Open Hardware board, compatible both with 8-bit
  (PIC18F with built-in USB module only) and 32-bit (PIC32MX) ©Microchip Microcontrollers.
* Pinguino uses free and open source compilers ([SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/),
  small device C compiler; and [gcc-mips-elf](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/MIPS-Options.html),
  a targeted version of gcc for PIC32 microcontrollers) available for GNU/Linux,
  Windows and Mac OS X.
* Pinguino is a firmware/bootloader that control the Pinguino Board.
* Pinguino is 90% compatible with Arduino Language and Libraries.

## Pinguino IDE

Pinguino IDE is cross-platform, it run on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. With this IDE, 
you can write, compile and upload code to your board.

[Download and install it](/getting-started/download) to start.
Read more about [Pinguino IDE v13](/pinguino-ide-v13/) to learn.

## Pinguino boards

[Pinguino boards](/pinguino-boards/) are an open hardware electronics prototyping platform, that can be 
[purchased](/pinguino-boards/buy), or [build at yourself (DIY)](/pinguino-boards/DIY).

Pinguino comes with a USB Bootloader too. This small program running inside the microcontroller
is responsible for transferring your application from your PC to the microcontroller memory
and handing over the control to this program afterwards.

## Getting help

The first stop is our newly [Community page](https://github.com/PinguinoIDE/pinguinoide.github.io/discussions), where users can post their queries.

And if something doesn't work as it should, you can always create a ticket in the issues
section of the project's Github page:
